This distinction between postdiction and prediction is appreciated conceptually but is not respected in practice. Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of predictions reduces the credibility of research findings. However, ordinary biases in human reasoning, such as hindsight bias, make it hard to avoid this mistake. An effective solution is to define the research questions and analysis plan before observing the research outcomes{\textemdash}a process called preregistration. Preregistration distinguishes analyses and outcomes that result from predictions from those that result from postdictions. A variety of practical strategies are available to make the best possible use of preregistration in circumstances that fall short of the ideal application, such as when the data are preexisting. Services are now available for preregistration across all disciplines, facilitating a rapid increase in the practice. Widespread adoption of preregistration will increase distinctiveness between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing and will improve the credibility of research findings.},

   increase the credibility of the published scientific literature and
   accelerate discovery. Here we argue for the adoption of measures to
   optimize key elements of the scientific process: methods, reporting and
   dissemination, reproducibility, evaluation and incentives. There is some
   evidence from both simulations and empirical studies supporting the
   likely effectiveness of these measures, but their broad adoption by
   researchers, institutions, funders and journals will require iterative
   evaluation and improvement. We discuss the goals of these measures, and
   how they can be implemented, in the hope that this will facilitate
   action toward improving the transparency, reproducibility and efficiency
   of scientific research.}},

abstract = {Summary We present an r package, ggtree, which provides programmable visualization and annotation of phylogenetic trees. ggtree can read more tree file formats than other softwares, including newick, nexus, NHX, phylip and jplace formats, and support visualization of phylo, multiphylo, phylo4, phylo4d, obkdata and phyloseq tree objects defined in other r packages. It can also extract the tree/branch/nodeâspecific and other data from the analysis outputs of beast, epa, hyphy, paml, phylodog, pplacer, r8s, raxml and revbayes software, and allows using these data to annotate the tree. The package allows colouring and annotation of a tree by numerical/categorical node attributes, manipulating a tree by rotating, collapsing and zooming out clades, highlighting user selected clades or operational taxonomic units and exploration of a large tree by zooming into a selected portion. A twoâdimensional tree can be drawn by scaling the tree width based on an attribute of the nodes. A tree can be annotated with an associated numerical matrix (as a heat map), multiple sequence alignment, subplots or silhouette images. The package ggtree is released under the artisticâ2.0 license. The source code and documents are freely available through bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/ggtree).}
